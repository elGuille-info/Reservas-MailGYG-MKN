*IMPORTANT*:
Remember that you must be at the company’s counter (Maro Kayak Nerja, which is right when you arrive at the beach) *15 minutes before the activity’s departure time* if you are late, the reservation will be canceled and there will be no refund of the amount paid.

You don’t need to queue, go directly to the counter and tell them you have a reserved route.

If you have any issues, please contact us by sending a *WhatsApp message at +34645761689* indicating the name used to make the reservation and the time you have the activity.



*GETTING TO MARO BEACH*:
Maro beach is located in a natural area and vehicles, except for authorized ones, cannot reach the beach.

If you bring your own vehicle, keep in mind that in high season it can be complicated to find parking, so we recommend that you calculate an hour or more to park and go down to the beach.

There is a bus service (offered by the Nerja town hall and it is not free, but it is not expensive either: €1.5 round trip) that takes you from the main parking lot on the road down to the beach, that bus leaves at the hour o'clock.
You can also walk down to the beach, the estimated time from the parking lot is about 17 minutes.
If you prefer to go by taxi, it will take you near the beach, it will leave you in the same place as the bus/shuttle.



*WE RECOMMEND*:
- Cap, sunscreen, water, short sleeve shirt to avoid chafing from the life jacket. (For guided tours, we lend you diving goggles without a tube).
- Eat something, at least a piece of fruit, 30 minutes before the activity.

- We can keep a backpack with your valuables (keys, wallet, mobiles, glasses, etc.).
- We do not keep: Towels, coolers, chairs, umbrellas, masks or loose clothing.
- We do not have waterproof bags or containers, everything that goes in the kayak gets wet.

- Our guided tours include a free photo report, which *will be shared after 5 days* via email or WhatsApp link with all members of the tour group, as long as there are no technical problems.

Thank you very much!



*Please read this*, the town of Maro is very small and there are few places to park. If you do not go by taxi to Maro beach, please calculate at least an hour and a half to park and if you do not find any parking in the town, you can go to the parking lot of the Nerja Caves, although it is paid.
I am warning you because if you are not at Maro beach 15 minutes before the activity time, you will lose your reservation.
Thank you for your understanding. ????



*Please note that* at the time you have the route, the bus will probably not be in operation (and you have to be 15 minutes before the start of the activity at the counter of the company that carries out the activity), I say this so that you can calculate that going down to the beach from the parking lot can take about 20 or 30 minutes (according to Google Maps it is 1.3 KM and 17 minutes walking). ??
